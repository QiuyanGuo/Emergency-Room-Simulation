# 590PR Final_Project
Our project is to make a simulation for emergency room.
Our goal is to see the utilization of doctors and nurses. When utilization is greater than 1, it means the all doctors
and nurse are busy and coming patients have to wait. So if utilization is greater than 1, we calculate the waiting time.

Utilization calculation - Nanzhu Liu
Waiting time calculation - Qiuyan Guo
